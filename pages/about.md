Software-defined container storage enables organizations to merge
storage services with container platforms in a manner similar to any
other container service, and can run on physical, virtual, cloud and
traditional storage appliances. Gluster Container Storage aka
GlusterCS, aims to offer a better storage management experience with a
leaner Gluster stack underneath with focus on helping users to stay
away from their storage related worries especially when working on a
hybrid cloud environment.

GlusterCS with a vision of abstracting storage layer as much as
possible tries to answer the following questions

- Can storage behave like an application? 
- Is digital transformation possible without storage transformation?
- Can storage be everywhere and yet nowhere?
- Un-Storage for the modern enterprise.
